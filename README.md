# react-multi-select
Multiselection list in react.

```shell
# install dependencies
yarn
# build production bundle
yarn build
# run the tests
yarn test
```

### TODOS
- Abstract element creation using `React.createElement` so any element can be rendered as selectable - `a`, `li`, `tr`, `td`, etc
- Construct examples and sample use cases
- Look into performance and re-renders
- Implement es5 bundle output

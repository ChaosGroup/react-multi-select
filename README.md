React components that provide multiple selection logic. Features mouse and keyboard selections. Can render arbitary tags as selectable items.

```shell
# install dependencies
yarn
# build production bundle
yarn build
# run the tests
yarn test
```

### Examples
1. [selectable paragraphs](./examples/selectable-paragraphs/src/App.js)

### TODOS
- ~Abstract element creation using `React.createElement` so any element can be rendered as selectable - `a`, `li`, `tr`, `td`, etc~
- Construct examples and sample use cases
- Look into performance and re-renders
- Implement es5 bundle output
